# oscommerce_schnittstelle

This work is based on previous efforts to connect the Lx-Office ERP-system with an 
online storefront. In this case it is inteded to connect the original SQL Ledger
with a classic online store, namely osCommerce 2.3 series.

The project has the following goals:

 * Lx-Office was a fork from SQL Ledger and this project intends to bring back the 
   fork's efforts back to the original project (SQL Ledger series 3 and osCommerce 2.3 only).
 * Improved code documentation
 * Multilingual user interface as the application only supported German language


Challenges

 * Most users of SQL Ledger mainly use the Postgres database to store their company data. 
 * On the other hand osCommerce relies on a classic LAMP-stack and uses MySQL as a database server.
